## Project Overview

The Stock Rate Prediction project aims to analyze historical stock data and make trading decisions based on candlestick patterns. This application uses various technical patterns, such as Doji, Shooting Star, and Engulfing patterns, to predict whether to buy or sell a given stock on specific days.

## Key Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance API.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Implements algorithms to identify significant candlestick patterns:
  - **Shooting Star**
  - **Hammer**
  - **Bullish Engulfing**
  - **Bearish Engulfing**
  - **Doji**
  - **Morning Star**
  - **Evening Star**
- **Trading Simulation**: Simulates trading based on identified patterns and calculates profit/loss.
- **Visualization**: Displays stock price trends and trading signals using Chart.js.

## How It Works
The application fetches historical stock prices for a specified symbol (e.g., AAPL) from an API.
It analyzes the data to identify trading signals based on various candlestick patterns.
The application simulates trades, tracks transactions, calculates net profit, and visualizes the results.
